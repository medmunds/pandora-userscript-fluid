[Note that pandora-fluid.user.js was originally derived from
https://github.com/bigethan/pandora-userscript-fluid/blob/7d15ecd2b38d7c46784976a1018af32b6211f46e/pandora-fluid.user.js
which had no declared license at that time. Although the version
in this fork was completely rewritten, license terms from the
upstream project may apply to that one file.]
